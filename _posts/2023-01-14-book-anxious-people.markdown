#### Overview
Book is a pretty funny book about a very strange situation.  I didn't realize the story was going to be about each person who were stuck in the hostage situation.  I thought it was going to more about a bank robber and the police trying to catch him but it turned out to be about the internal struggles that each person has.  I wasn't expecting the couple of twists in the book (rabbit, bank robber being female, old lady owning the apartment)

#### Liked
I really enjoyed the comedy in the book.  A lot of it is geared towards an older generation.  I don't think younger people can understand some of the jokes or the communtary as it's very much about someone who's lived part of a life and can reflect back on ones self and not take themselves so seriously.

#### Psychologist
I wasn't expecting the psychologist to be the girl who attempted to throw herself off the bridge.  I did like the book did talk about how much a person killing themselves impacts those around them - both immediate and total strangers.

#### Didn't like
I had a hard time relating to the bank robber but once it became clear it was a woman the reaction of the people in the apartment made a little more sense.

#### Police
I liked how the police were portrayed as real people who have feelings.  I find too many books make police too single dimensional.  The relationship between the father son duo felt weak.  I can only imagine trying to work with my son without wanting to murder him.
