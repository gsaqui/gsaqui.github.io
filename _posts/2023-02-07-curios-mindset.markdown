#### Overview
I spent some time thinking how to foster curiosity in myself as well as the people inside the company I work at.

#### Work

-  we are less likely to fall prey to confirmation bias (looking for information that supports our beliefs rather than for evidence suggesting we are wrong) and to stereotyping people (making broad judgments, such as that women or minorities don’t make good leaders)
- When we are curious, we view tough situations more creatively. Studies have found that curiosity is associated with less defensive reactions to stress and less aggressive reactions to provocation. We also perform better when we’re curious.
- Seeking efficiency to the detriment of exploration.
-  “What is the one thing I should do to make things better for you?”

- Share your ideas or new things you've learned
    - forces you to learn enough to teach/pass on information

- Schedule ample time for learning activities to nurture your mind and spirit.


#### Schools

Take away
- celebrate mistakes (how can we encourage the team to try new things)
- Model curiosity and the team may choose to follow


#### How I used this information

- Our company has bi-weekly lightning talks where someone can speak about anything.  The goal is for it to be short and for people to take risks.  This is meant to be a safe space. 
  - I make an effort to show my curiosity by presenting 
  - I try to encourage my employees to present on any topic that interests them
  - We try to give people work time to spend researching what they would like to present
- Our company also offers monthly tech-talks which are a little more focussed on tech 
  - We try hard to have people present technology focussed topics (this can be a bit of a struggle)
- We are going to launch a quarterly polish week - similar to [Polish at Asana](https://blog.asana.com/2013/06/new-features-from-polish-week/)
  - People must have a SMART goal at the start and present the idea they would like to attempt
  - At the end of the week they must present what they worked on
  - We will celebrate all failures and successes
- We are going to create a rotation of members moving between teams 
  - There have been people in different teams wanting to learn different programming languages and frameworks
- It was raised by my awesome colleague that being out of your comfort zone 25% of the time is probably alright but 75% probably means it is stressful
