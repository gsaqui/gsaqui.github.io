Below you'll find my standard white loaf.  This uses a poolish which is essentially a slop that you make the night before.
A poolish is meant to add a buttery flavour to the bread.  

### Poolish
500g white flour
500g water
0.4g yeast

### Main bread
- 500g white flour
- All the poolish
- 0.4g yeast
- 22g salt
- 200g warmer water

#### Note
I can't be bothered to measure 0.4g so I just sprinkle it in.  Remember it is bread not a science experiment
so if you get it wrong you won't fail.

### Schedule

- 7pm Make poolish
- 8am mix everything together
- 9am fold the bread
- 10am fold the bread
- 3pm Shape bread into a ball and store it in the fridge in a proofing bread basket
- 7pm or later head oven to 450F for 45 minutes
- Bread goes in with a lid for 30 minutes
- Take lid off of bread and bake for another 25 minutes and lower the temperature to 425F
- Bring bread out and be the winner in your household
