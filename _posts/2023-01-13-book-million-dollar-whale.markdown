#### Overview
Follows the story of a man who stole a pile of money from Malaysia.  It's really a story of how easy it is to corrupt people with large sums of money

#### Thoughts
The writing was very in-depth as they followed the rise and almost fall of the Jho Low who figured out ways to stash money around the world.  Setting up shell accounts in the cayman islands.  Sadly it showed how little people think and how they are corrupted by money and having a chance to be part of it.  Low threw money around and made everyone feel like they were part of the "tribe" and encouraged people to join in and enjoy some of the money he was spending.  All the white people should be ashamed as they didn't do their due diligence and just assumed that because he was asian and from a country they didn't know a lot about then the money must be clean. I also don't think they cared because they were getting paid.  I think there would have been more calls for clarity of money if it was in the west.

I found it crazy that Jho Low is just hiding out in China and hasn't been punished for the crime that he has committed.  Once again it's the bankers stealing the money and getting away with it.

#### Overview
Book is a pretty funny book about a very strange situation.  I didn't realize the story was going to be about each person who were stuck in the hostage situation.  I thought it was going to more about a bank robber and the police trying to catch him but it turned out to be about the internal struggles that each person has.  I wasn't expecting the couple of twists in the book (rabbit, bank robber being female, old lady owning the apartment)

#### Liked
I really enjoyed the comedy in the book.  A lot of it is geared towards an older generation.  I don't think younger people can understand some of the jokes or the commentary as it's very much about someone who's lived part of a life and can reflect back on ones self and not take themselves so seriously.

#### psychologist
I wasn't expecting the psychologist to be the girl who attempted to throw herself off the bridge.  I did like the book did talk about how much a person killing themselves impacts those around them - both immediate and total strangers.

#### Didn't like
I had a hard time relating to the bank robber but once it became clear it was a woman the reaction of the people in the apartment made a little more sense.

#### Police
I liked how the police were portrayed as real people who have feelings.  I find too many books make police too single dimensional.  The relationship between the father son duo felt weak.  I can only imagine trying to work with my son without wanting to murder him.
