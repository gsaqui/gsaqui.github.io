Follows the life of Bo Jackson from the time he was a child all the way until his last baseball game.

#### Liked
When I was a kid Bo Jackson was considered the greatest athlete off all time.  Anytime a kid played more than one sport
and was good at that sport we always called them Bo.  This book went into the amazing athletic feats this man was able
to accomplish.  Reading the book and hearing how professional athletes, the best of the best, were amazed at the natural
ability of Bo Jackson blew my mind.  The book touches Super Techno Bowl on the Nintendo and how great Bo Jackson was.
I had this game and played it 4+ hours a day with my best friend Robbie (he was better than me).  My hands would be sore from pushing the horrible
keypad and I remember if one of us took the Raiders all you could hope for was Bo getting an injury.  Every page was
another amazing thing that Bo did - I found it hard to put down.  The author, Jeff Pearlman, did a fantastic job
researching and looking into how Bo was raised and how he led his life.

#### Did not like
In the book it often talks about how Bo Jackson was not nice to the media and he didn't like to sign autographs for other
players.  Learning one of your hero's was not always a nice person is hard to swallow.  It didn't change anything about
how I feel about the legend of Bo Jackson, but it does take the shine off him a little.  

#### Random thoughts
Bo was human just like the rest of us.  He had his faults and he had his strengths.  In the end I believe he walked away 
from sport and found his own life.  From how the book is written it does not seem like he felt like he missed out because
of his injuries.  He seems to have found his own life away from sports which is nice to see as many athletes whole life
is sport and when they walk away they seem to struggle.  Bo has been married to the same lady since 1987 - Linda Jackson - 
who like my wife became a psychologist.  I like that he stayed with her through all his fame and fortune.  What really came
out in the book was how important being a family man was to Bo - more so then the fame.

#### Would I recommend it?
Anyone who grew up in the 1980s and liked sport should read this book.
