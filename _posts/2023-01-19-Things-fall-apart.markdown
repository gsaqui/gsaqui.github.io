#### Overview
Follows the life of someone living in a tribe in nigeria and how things change over time for the people living there.

#### Liked
I liked how they portrayed all the different people in the family.  They followed the life of a male throughout his life
and how his actions impacted how he was treated.  They showed how he was married to many women and the women all took care of
the other wives children.  What I found interesting was when the white people came and setup the church I liked how they offered 
two different views of the church - the positive view that the lower caste people were treated as equals but also that the church and the 
white people that ran the church didn't respect the local gods and how that hurt/insulted the locals.

#### Did not like
I would have liked to have more insight in the church and the people who were running it.  From a historical point of view
I would have been interested in how the rollout of church and how the government was impacted by it.  I wonder if the 
top-down structure of the church hierarchy impacted or shaped the culture in any way.

#### Random thoughts
This is supposedly one of the most studied books in Africa, and it gave a clear view of what life was like in parts
of Nigeria.  The book was published in 1958 by a Nigerian who I assume either grew up in a tribe like the one described in the book
or had family members grow up like that.  It's interesting reading about a culture where the male plays such an important role
in the family.  I'm not suggesting it is better in any way, but I feel, at least in my household, that my wife has the 
same responsibility to make sure the family and children succeed.  I got the sense that there is a lot of pressure
on the male figures, at least in this book, to provide for their family.
