I hate going to sites that offer recipes, and then you have to scroll to the bottom of the post
to read the recipe.  This is a recipe that I found in the great Living Breads book.  It's a buckwheat loaf that looks like a donut. 
You can see from the picture mine does not look like the one from the author.  Once I cut it open and had some the earthly flavour really came out.  The buckwheat taste is unique and really nice as it brings a lot of flavour to the loaf.  I tried without butter, with butter, and then with jam.  You can never fail when you add jam to bread but I was surprised I preferred the bread without butter than with butter.  I think it allowed the deep flavours of the bread to come out.  Considering buckwheat only makes up 15% of the bakers percentage of the bread really carried the buckwheat flavour.  I highly recommend trying this bread out.

## Recipe

#### Firm levain starter

| Ingredient | weight |
| ---        | ---    |
|Sourdough starter | 17g|
|water | 49g |
|flour | 75g|

#### Final dough

| Ingredient | weight |
| ---        | ---    |
|Flour | 400g|
|Buckwheat flour | 71g |
|Water | 376g|
|salt | 11g |
| Dry yeast | 0.5g|
| Firm levain starter | 141g|

#### Steps

1. Mix all the ingredients in the firm starter together and leave on the counter over night (8-12 hours)
2. Mix all the ingredients together and then using a kitchenaid mixer mix on Level 4 for 25 minutes
3. Put dough into the fridge for at least 8 hours 
4. Preheat oven at 475c for a least an hour with a baking stone and a cast iron pan 
5. While the oven is getting hot stretch the dough and then make into circle.  Let the dough rest between an inner bowl and an outer bowl.  Make sure it rises for at least an hour and no longer than 90 minutes.  I suggest you let it rise on parchment paper and put parchment paper between the dough and the inner bowl so it doesn't stick too badly. 
6. Put dough into the oven and add a handful of ice-cubes to the tray 
7. Bake for 10 minutes and then lower the temperature to 400 for 35-40 minutes
